AUTOMATING VBA MACRO DOCUMENTATION  AND TRANSFORMATION

**ABTRACT**
In the realm of software automation and documentation, the project focuses on automating the extraction and analysis of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros embedded within Excel files. Leveraging Python and its libraries, the system facilitates the seamless extraction of VBA code, parsing it into a structured Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and subsequently analyzing its components. The analysis covers logic structures, data flow patterns, and process flows within each VBA module. The generated insights are then compiled into detailed documentation, enhancing visibility and comprehension of complex VBA functionalities. This automation not only improves efficiency in understanding legacy VBA codebases but also serves as a robust tool for ongoing maintenance and enhancement of Excel-based applications.
